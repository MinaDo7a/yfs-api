Follow Conventional Commits format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` where type is one of feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, or ci; scope uses resource names like auth, oauth1, oauth2, game, league, team, player, transaction, user, client, http, types, utils, deps, config, or tests; and subject is ≤72 characters in imperative mood, lowercase, with no trailing period. Use the body to explain what and why (not how), and reference issues in the footer with `Fixes #123` or `Closes #456`.
